- Actually, we could just say HCI, however, we do want to emphasize the high-tech feel that AI brings with -- AI further defines the "C" and "I" in HCI.  
 
- The "I" part can cover literature, history, and philosophy, so, the whole area can be generalized as digital (cognitive) humanites. Note that the modifier "digital" can also be interpreted as the agent, hence makes the agent explicit, and, it leads to another agent "(human)cognitive" also.
